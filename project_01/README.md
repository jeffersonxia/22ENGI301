There are 3 operatble codes in this repository. A timer, introduction, and a letter randomizer.

As I have yet to implement a means of finding a "home" position, you will have to manually reset the displays to the "0" position to get accurate results.

After reseting the display, use "sudo python3 _____.py" to run the code. 

You will need to install the bbpystepper library for the code to work.
